# Project_findTreasure

Author: Jiawei Hao

Task: Implement data structure and algorithm to find treasure located in a 2D vector map. 

Introduction: The pirate start at '@' in the map and will follow certain search algorithm to find the treasure '$'. Throughout the searching process, searched paths, directions, total path length, and several other variables are tracked through member variables of customized Map class. Data structures are opitimized so that the program takes less time and space during runtime. The maps are written in txt files and are read through input redirection. Several command line argument options are provided that could be used to determine the algorithm that is used to search treasure.
